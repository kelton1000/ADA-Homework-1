## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#Challenge 1

string <- gsub(pattern= "[[:punct:]]", replacement= "", x= string)

split_quote <- unlist(split_quote)

#Challenge 2

  data = seq (from = 1, to = 159, by = 2),
  nrow = 8,
  ncol = 10
)

m2 = m1[3:6, 4:9]

#They are all modes


#Challenge 3

a [1, 1, 1, 2]
a [2, 3, 2]
a [1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
